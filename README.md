 This is my second app which is used to display weather based on the city name.
 
 In this app it will initially display the your current location weather after that when you enter your desired city name it will display that place weather.
 
 Steps to create the app
 
 git --version
node --version
npm --version
npm install -g create-react-app
npm install
create-react-app --version

create-react-app <projectname>

cd <projectname>
 
npm install redux react-redux

npm start

if errror comes then run this command 
npm install react-scripts@2.1.8
then 
npm start
